/**
 * A convenience class used in the REST API to POST a new Group Condition.
 * <p>
 * A group-level condition uses dataId tokens for the dataIds defined in the condition.  The group members
 * must then replace the tokens with actual dataIds.  For example, we may define a group ThresholdCondition like
 * ( $SystemLoad$ > 80 ).  Each member must then replace $SystemLoad$ with the actual system load dataId for that
 * member. See {@link #setDataIdMemberMap(Map)} for details on how to construct the map supplying the
 * dataId substitutions.

     * has data1Id and data2Id), it may have more entries that conditions. The inner map maps member triggerIds to
     * the dataId to be used for that member trigger for the given token.  It should have 1 entry for each
     * member trigger.  For example, let's define a group trigger with two conditions:
     * <p><code>ThresholdCondition( $SystemLoad$ > 80 )</code></p>
     * <p><code>ThresholdCondition( $HeapUsed$ > 70 )</code></p>
     * If the group has two current members, with triggerId's Member1 and Member2, the map would look like this:
     * <pre>
     * {[key   = "$SystemLoad$",
     *   value = {[key   = "Member1",

     *  [key   = "$HeapUsed$",
     *   value = {[key   = "Member1",

     *           }
     *  ]
     * }
     * </pre><p>
     * So, in the example the actual $SystemLoad$ dataIds would be <code>Member1SystemLoad</code> and
     * <code>Member2SystemLoad</code>.  With this Map we can now add the group-level conditions and also the
     * two member-level conditions to each member.

     * A NOTE ABOUT EXTERNAL CONDITIONS. <code>ExternalCondition.expression</code> will automatically have the
     * same token replacement performed. So, all occurrences of the dataId token found in the expression, will be
     * replaced with the mapping. This allows the expression of a group external condition to be automatically
     * customized to the member.
     * </p>
