/**
 * A convenience class used in the REST API to un-orphan an orphan group Member Trigger.
 * <p>
 * A group-level condition uses dataId tokens for the dataIds defined in the condition.  The group members
 * must then replace the tokens with actual dataIds.  For example, we may define a group ThresholdCondition like
 * ( $SystemLoad$ > 80 ).  Each member must then replace $SystemLoad$ with the actual system load dataId for that
 * member. See {@link #setDataIdMap(Map)} for details on how to construct the map supplying the dataId substitutions.
