*Hawkular Alerting* is the alerts module for Hawkular. It is responsible to define conditions rules over data events
and fire alerts that can be sent by several action plugins.

Hawkular is a modular systems monitoring suite, that consists of several sub-projects for
storing of metrics, alerting on incoming events and more. Those projects are developed
in their own GitHub repositories and integrated in this project.

== About Alerts

The project is divided into several modules

[cols=">s,d"]
|=======================
| hawkular-alerts-api |
This is the public Java API for alerts component. +
Users should use only this API to interact with alerts.
| hawkular-alerts-engine |
This is the implementation of the alerts engine. +
It is responsible to manage the alerts definitions and the evaluation of the alerts conditions. +
It includes a rules engine as part of the implementation details.
| hawkular-alerts-rest |
This is a public REST API for alerts component. +
It is a wrapper of the main *hawkular-alerts-api*.
| hawkular-alerts-bus |
This component is responsible for the communication between the alerts engine and the bus. +
*hawkular-alerts-engine* is decoupled from the bus, so it can be used in other scenarios +
(i.e. standalone, third party alerts system).
| hawkular-alerts-bus-api |
This is the public API for message objects used in *hawkular-alerts-bus*. +
| hawkular-alerts-actions-api |
Common API for action plugins. +
An action plugin will be deployed as a .war artifact.
| hawkular-alerts-actions-impl |
Component responsible of the communication of the plugins with the engine directly using Java API +
It is used on standalone deployments.
| hawkular-alerts-actions-plugins |
Alert actions plugins. +
Main responsabilities are: +
- Publish supported properties. +
- Process actions messages.
| hawkular-alerter-metrics |
Optional component used to offer advance evaluation of complex Metrics expressions that interact with the Alerts system.
|=======================

== Getting started

*Hawkular Alerting* can be built with the following steps:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-alerts.git
    cd hawkular-alerts
    mvn clean install
```

== Integration tests

There is a integration test suite that downloads a wildfly server and deploys *hawkular-alerts* with an embedded
cassandra service.
These integration tests can be executed using *-Pitest* profile:

```shell
mvn clean install -Pitest
```

== Performance tests

There is a performance test suite focus in the *hawkular-alerts-engine* project.
These tests are not active by default, they can be run using *-Dtest-env=perf* variable:

```shell
mvn clean install -Dtest-env=perf
```

== Clustering tests

There is a clustering test suite focus on partition and distribution of the triggers and data across
a topology of nodes.
These test are not active by default, they can be run using *-Denv=cluster* variable:

```shell
mvn clean install -Denv=cluster
```

== Building REST API documentation

REST API documentation can be generated using *-Pdocgen* profile. +
The doc is generated under *hawkular-alerts-rest/target* folder.

```shell
mvn clean install -Pdocgen
```
