= Elasticsearch Integration

This example shows how to integrate Elasticsearch with Hawkular Alerting.

The scripts used for this example are written in bash. +
Those are pretty simple and can be translated a different environment easily.

== Install Elasticsearch

Download and install Elasticsearch and Kibana

[source,shell]
----
    ES_HOME= # Directory to install Elasticsearch productos
    cd $ES_HOME
    wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/zip/elasticsearch/2.4.4/elasticsearch-2.4.4.zip
    unzip elasticsearch-2.4.4.zip
    # Kibana is platform dependent
    # Adjust the package to your platform
    wget https://download.elastic.co/kibana/kibana/kibana-4.6.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    tar xvfz kibana-4.6.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
----

Run Elasticsearch on localhost

[source,shell]
----
    cd $ES_HOME
    elasticsearch-2.4.4/bin/elasticsearch
----

Open a new shell and run Kibana on localhost

[source,shell]
----
    kibana-4.6.4-linux-x86_64/bin/kibana
----

[TIP]
Elasticsearch 2.4.4 and Kibana 4.6.4 versions are used in OpenShift 3.6 as logging system. +
Hawkular Alerting is compatible with versions up to 5.2 versions.

== Install Hawkular Alerting

Build a Hawkular Alerting standalone distribution

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    cd hawkular-alerts
    mvn clean install
----

Start the standalone server

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    cd hawkular-alerts/hawkular-alerts-rest-tests/target/wildfly-10.0.0.Final/
    bin/standalone.sh
----

[TIP]
.Test Email server
==================
By default, Hawkular Alerting will send email notifications using a SMTP server on localhost:25, for demo purposes
 a test smtp server can be used to validate the reception of the emails. +
  +
Hawkular Alerting has been tested using
  https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/[FakeSMTP]. +
  +
A GUI SMTP server can be set up with these steps:
[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    git clone https://github.com/Nilhcem/FakeSMTP
    cd FakeSMTP
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    cd target
    sudo java -jar fakeSMTP-*.jar
----
==================

== Create Trigger definitions

Run the definitions script

[source,shell]
----
    ./create-definitions.sh
----

This scripts defines two triggers and three actions:

=== Alert on any Backend ERROR log for AppA

The goal of this trigger is to detect from Elasticsearch any ERROR message related to Backend from AppA.

First, this trigger is tagged with _Elasticsearch_

[source,json]
----
    "tags": {
      "Elasticsearch": "Localhost instance"
    }
----

Then the Elasticsearch alerter will start pulling log documents and convert them into Hawkular Alerting Events
that will be evaluated by EventConditions.

Context can be used to indicate paremeters of the Elasticsearch query and the Hawkular Events mapping

[source]
----
    "context": {
      // Time interval between queries to Elasticsearch
      "interval": "30s",

      // Field used to fetch documents in timeseries
      "timestamp": "@timestamp",

      // Documents will be queried from index log and filtered for AppA
      // Filter is optional, then we could fetch all messages under index log
      // On this case all messages would be evaluated
      "index": "log",
      "filter": "{\"match\":{\"app\":\"AppA\"}}",

      // Documents are parsed into Hawkular Alerting Events using the following mapping
      "mapping": "level:category,@timestamp:ctime,message:text,app:dataId,index:tags"
    }
----

Once that we have the documents as Events inside Hawkular Alerting we can use an EventCondition to detect events coming
from _AppA_ with category _ERROR_ and _Backend_ as part of the main text

[source]
----
    "conditions":[
        {
          "type": "EVENT",
          "dataId": "AppA",
          "expression": "category == 'ERROR',text contains 'Backend'"
        }
    ]
----

=== Alert on WARN messages for AppB

The goal of this trigger is to detect from Elasticsearch when the number of WARN messages for AppB exceeds some threshold.

First, this trigger is tagged with _Elasticsearch_

[source,json]
----
    "tags": {
      "Elasticsearch": "Localhost instance"
    }
----

Then the Elasticsearch alerter will start pulling log documents and convert them into Hawkular Alerting Events
that will be evaluated by EventConditions.

[source]
----
    "context": {
      // Time interval between queries to Elasticsearch
      "interval": "30s",

      // Field used to fetch documents in timeseries
      "timestamp": "@timestamp",

      // Documents will be queried from index log and filtered for AppB
      // Filter is optional, then we could fetch all messages under index log
      // On this case all messages would be evaluated
      "index": "log",
      "filter": "{\"match\":{\"app\":\"AppB\"}}",

      // Documents are parsed into Hawkular Alerting Events using the following mapping
      "mapping": "level:category,@timestamp:ctime,message:text,app:dataId,index:tags"
    }
----

Once that we have the documents as Events inside Hawkular Alerting we can use an EventCondition to detect events coming
from _AppB_ with category _WARN_

[source]
----
    "conditions":[
        {
          "type": "EVENT",
          "dataId": "AppB",
          "expression": "category == 'ERROR'"
        }
    ]
----

We do not want to be alerted on each WARN message, but when we have a suspicious increase of WARN messages.
This could be modeled in several ways, for our example we are going to use a Dampening to detect when there are three
or more WARN messages from a total of ten messages evaluated

[source]
----
    "dampenings": [
        {
          "triggerMode": "FIRING",
          "type":"RELAXED_COUNT",
          "evalTrueSetting": 3,
          "evalTotalSetting": 10
        }
    ]
----

=== Actions

Two of the actions defined in the example show how to write the alerts generated into Elasticsearch.

The action _write-full-alert_ writes full Hawkular Alert json into Elasticsearch. Properties can indicate under which
index or type the alerts will be written.

[source]
----
    {
      "actionPlugin": "elasticsearch",
      "actionId": "write-full-alert",
      "properties": {
        // Index under alerts will be written in Elasticsearch
        "index": "alerts_full"
      }
    }
----

A full Hawkular Alert contains a lot of detailed information about the environment when an alert was generated (trigger,
conditions, evaluations). In a second we are going to show how to map the Hawkular Alert into a custom format

[source]
----
    {
      "actionPlugin": "elasticsearch",
      "actionId": "write-partial-alert",
      "properties": {
        // Index under alerts will be written in Elasticsearch
        "index": "alerts_summary",

        // If present timestamps fields from Alert will be parsed on this format
        "timestamp_pattern": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ",

        // A Shift JSON -> JSON transformation to convert Alert object into a light custom document
        "transform": "{
                \"tenantId\":\"tenant\",
                \"ctime\":\"timestamp\",
                \"text\":\"trigger\",
                \"context\":{
                    \"interval\":\"fetch-interval\"
                },
                \"evalSets\":{
                    \"*\":{
                        \"*\":{
                            \"condition\":{
                                \"expression\":\"details.[&3][&2].expression\",
                                \"dataId\":\"details.[&3][&2].dataId\"
                            },
                            \"value\":\"details.[&2][&1].value\"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }"
      }
----



== Create Logs Documents

Run the log script

[source,shell]
----
    ./create-logs.sh
