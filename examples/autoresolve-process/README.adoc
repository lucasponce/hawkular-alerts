= Autoresolve Process

This example shows how to use AUTORESOLVE triggers in Hawkular Alerting.

Hawkular Alerting offers the flexibility to detect when a bad situation occurs, firing an Alert, but also,
the ability to detect when the bad status is resolved.

This mechanism is implemented using a Trigger with FIRING and AUTORESOLVE conditions.

FIRING conditions are defined to detect bad situations (i.e. a process is down), meanwhile AUTORESOLVE conditions
define when a bad situation is resolved (i.e. a processs is up).

With this mechanism, we will be notified only when the bad situation is detected, avoiding to repeat multiple
notifications for the same bad situation. Only a new notification will be sent when the situation is recovered.

In this example we are going to detect a specific process (by default a firefox process), notifying on UP and DOWN
states.

The scripts are written in groovy to make them work from maven in any platorm but those are pretty simple and can be
translated to bash or a different environment easily.

== Running the example

Build a Hawkular Alerting standalone distribution

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    cd hawkular-alerts
    mvn clean install
----

Start the standalone server

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    cd hawkular-alerts/hawkular-alerts-rest-tests/target/wildfly-10.0.0.Final/
    bin/standalone.sh
----

Open a new shell to run the autoresolve-process example

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    cd hawkular-alerts/examples/autoresolve-process
    mvn validate
    ## Use mvn validate -Dprocess=otherprocess to change the process to monitor
----

[TIP]
.Test Email server
==================
By default, Hawkular Alerting will send email notifications using a SMTP server on localhost:25, for demo purposes
 a test smtp server can be used to validate the reception of the emails. +
  +
Hawkular Alerting has been tested using
  https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/[FakeSMTP]. +
  +
A GUI SMTP server can be set up with these steps:
[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    git clone https://github.com/Nilhcem/FakeSMTP
    cd FakeSMTP
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    cd target
    sudo java -jar fakeSMTP-*.jar
----
==================

== create_definitions.groovy

Create a trigger with two conditions to fire an alert when a process is down and update when the process is up:

    . Firing condition: availability data with id "process-status" is NOT_UP
    . Autoresolve condition: availability data with id "process-status" is UP

Trigger must set autoResolve and autoResolveAlerts flag to true.

Create an action definition to notify by email to admins group with cc to developers team.

== send_data.groovy

Invoke a shell command (Linux) to detect if the process is present and send a data for "process-status" over the REST
 API.

The detection of the process is OS dependent, this example is tested under Linux platforms.
For other platform this command should be changed for an equivalent expression:

[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
    def proc = ["sh", "-c", "ps -e | grep ${processName} | wc -l"].execute()
----
