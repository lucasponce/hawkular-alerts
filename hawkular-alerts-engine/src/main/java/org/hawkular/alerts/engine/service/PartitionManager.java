 * Interface that defines an abstract API with the clustering services used by the engine.

 *
 * In distributed scenarios triggers are partitioned across nodes in a consistent hashing algorithm.
 *
 * PartitionManager is responsible to notify when a trigger has been added, modified, removed, in order to
 * update the AlertsEngine state.
 *
 * PartionManager is responsible to detect changes on the topology to reconfigure the partition of the triggers in a
 * transparent way when a new node is added/removed from the cluster.
 *
 * PartitionManager is also responsible to notify when a new data has been received, in order to deliver to the
 * AlertsEngine node where trigger is active.
